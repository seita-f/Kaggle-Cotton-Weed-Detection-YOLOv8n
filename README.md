# 3LC Cottom Weed Detection (YOLOv8n only)
This competition is an object detection task aimed at identifying and classifying weeds (Carpetweed, Morning Glory, and Palmer Amaranth) in cotton fields. Due to real-world operational constraints, the model is limited to YOLOv8n, among other restrictions. The main objective is to achieve maximum performance within these real-world constraints using 3LC (Three Line Code).
